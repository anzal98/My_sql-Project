In this project, we explore the trends and patterns in Tata Steel's stock market data using MySQL. Our analysis is based on real-time data from the National Stock Exchange, spanning from March 24th, 2021 to March 24th, 2023.

Our analysis covers a range of topics, including stock price trends, trading volume, and market capitalization. We also look at the impact of external factors, such as news events and economic indicators, on Tata Steel's stock performance.
Overall, this project provides a comprehensive view of Tata Steel's stock market data, highlighting the key trends and patterns that emerged over the two-year period. Our analysis can be useful for investors, analysts, and anyone interested in understanding the dynamics of the stock market.
